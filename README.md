I start reading this "beast" , I do not know if it will be too difficult for me.
Here I will keep my notes :
1.Possible errata 
2.Questions that I have while reading the text (with answers if I manage to find them)
3.Improvements on the text (if I think that I can phrase something better than the original text)
