E-1.1  Tasks of the Kernel
   The first bullet says :
     "For example, when the kernel addresses a hard disk, it must decide
which path to use to copy data from disk to memory, where the data reside, which commands
must be sent to the disk via which path, and so on."
   Perharps it wanted to say :
      "For example, when the kernel addresses a hard disk, it must decide :
which path to use to copy data from memory (where the data reside) to disk ,
which commands must be sent to the disk via which path, 
and so on. "

"Each process is assigned address space in the virtual memory of the CPU".
So does this mean that there is a cincept of virtual memory for the CPU also?
